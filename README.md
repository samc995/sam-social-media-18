# sam-social-media-18

## Description


- My motivation was to create a social media platform using only the back end to test and see if it works.
- I built this project so I could test how well I would be able to create a social media platform.
- The problem solves the problem of being able to add/delete friends, write thoughts and reactions and communicate with other users.
- I learned how to effectively code in the backend to acheieve these goals and use insomnia to test and see if the code was working properly.
